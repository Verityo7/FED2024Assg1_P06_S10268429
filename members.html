                A wide-eyed hard worker. Minori was initially the only member of MORE MORE JUMP! 
                with no prior idol experience, but her work with the group has led to her garnering 
                a fanbase and performing in her first solo show. Now, she continues to work towards 
                her goal of becoming an A-list idol worthy of performing at the Dome.              
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading">Background</h2>
            <p class ="info">
                When Minori was a child, she would often have bad luck. After one particular day, 
                when she dropped the baton during a race at school, Minori stayed home out of guilt 
                and fear that her classmates would be angry at her. She then saw Haruka from ASRUN, 
                singing solo on TV. Minori was encouraged by Haruka's words that 
                "Tomorrow will always be a better day", and has been a fan of Haruka ever since. 
                Like her longtime inspiration, Minori also set her sights on becoming an idol. 
                She has tried her hand at over 50 auditions, but failed every single one. Despite this, 
                she never gave up and continued to try in order to achieve her dream.
                <br><br>
                While practicing on her school's roof, she met Haruka, who, along with Airi and Shizuku, 
                helped her train to become a fully fledged idol. Thanks to Minori's positive and hardworking nature, 
                she inspires hope in the other former idols and they form MORE MORE JUMP! together.
                <br><br>
                Minori has a younger brother who is currently in elementary school. 
                She also owns a pet Samoyed named Samo-chan.

                Minori is an optimistic, hard-working girl who has shown her determination and dedication 
                to becoming an idol, something others often compliment her on. She has a kind heart and tries 
                to be considerate of others. However, she is also clumsy, tends to get panicked easily, and often has 
                trouble keeping her composure. This is accompanied by her habit of saying whatever's on her mind, and 
                she seems to find it easy to express her emotions without restraint, purposefully or not. Despite her 
                clumsiness, she is extremely disciplined, both in idol training and in her habit of daily writing.
                <br><br>
                She looks up to many of her friends and classmates and aspires to be like them. 
                As she grows as both a person and an upcoming idol, she desires to bring the happiness 
                that Haruka used to feel as an idol before retirement. Although it may not seem like so upon 
                first meeting her, she is an empathetic and emotionally mature young girl. She has a habit 
                of repeating the phrase "more and more" ("もっともっと", motto motto in Japanese).

                Former member of ASRUN, an idol group known nationwide.The MORE MORE JUMP! solo show has left 
                Haruka more ready than ever to pursue her idol career. Along with Minori, she has decided to switch

            <p class ="info">
                As a child, Haruka had a difficult time smiling even when she was happy. She was inspired 
                to become an idol when, while at a mall, an idol invited Haruka to dance with her onstage, 
                causing Haruka to smile. Haruka realized she wanted to become an idol upon hearing that the 
                girl who invited her to dance was filled with hope by watching Haruka having fun. As a child 
                and while in middle school, Haruka was an athlete, specifically a basketball player.
                <br><br>
                In third grade, Haruka decided she wanted to become an idol. She then became part of the 
                nationally-acclaimed idol group ASRUN, where she ended up having the highest popularity 
                ranking among all the members of the group. After a falling-out with one of the other members, 
                she retired from being an idol and became a normal student at Miyamasuzaka Girls' Academy. 
                Shortly after her retirement, she meets Minori on the rooftop while looking for a place to read. 
                Soon, Minori, Airi, and Shizuku invite her to create MORE MORE JUMP! with them. She initially 
                refuses, until she is given hope by former ASRUN member Mai.

                Haruka is very charismatic, formerly being the most popular member of ASRUN. In Minori's words, 
                she is "the kind of idol who is able to give everyone hope for a better tomorrow". She is a strict 
                and dedicated person, working in regular routines of rigorous workouts to stay at an idol's standard. 
                However, due to her overly diligent nature, she has difficulty relaxing and giving herself a break. 
                This dedication applies to her studies, as the VIRTUAL SINGERS mention her excellent grades. She 
                restricts herself on sweets and pastries, which, in response, causes cravings. She is attentive 
                to the schedules and specials of pastry shops.
                <br><br>
                Haruka is composed yet bold, unafraid to talk back and tease her friends. She is rather sporty, 
                liking basketball, and as a child she was quite competitive. She also loves penguins, owns 
                a ton of penguin merch, and sometimes gets emotional when receiving penguin merch as a gift.

            <p class ="info">               
                Airi wanted to become an idol when she was young, as she admired the way they danced, sang 
                and made people smile, and wanted to be able to do the same. At the same time, she wanted 
                to be more girlish, as she was made fun of for being a tomboy and getting into fights with boys. 
                Airi was mainly inspired by an idol named Rainbow Garland, who was also the first idol she became a fan of.
                <br><br>
                Airi later debuted as a member of the idol group QT. She was a popular idol that appeared on many 
                variety shows. One of her most well-known TV personas was The Masked Variety Idol, Happy Everyday. 
                Due to her talent working in television, her agency urged her to stop being an idol and to become a 
                TV personality instead. Upon overhearing her manager outright saying that Airi is very average as an idol, 
                she rejected this offer, resulting in her quitting the group.
                <br><br>
                Airi seemingly gave up her dream of being an idol. She even insulted Minori when they first met 
                and said that she has no chance at becoming an idol. However, seeing Minori's spirit, she was reinvigorated 
                by her determination to reach her dream, thus agreeing to train Minori and create MORE MORE JUMP! with 
                Haruka and Airi's former rival Shizuku.
                <br><br>
                She is the middle child of her family, having one older sister and one younger sister. Her father is a good cook, 
                as Airi mentions him making her and her sisters lunch and Christmas Cake.
                <br><br>
                Airi is part of the Miyamasuzaka credit course alongside Shizuku. As a second year, Airi was classmates 
                with Shizuku in class 2-D. As a third year, she is classmates with Shizuku in class 3-E.

            <p class ="info">             
                Airi is strong-minded and comes across as pushy to some. According to Minori, she is strict but reliable. 
                She is very protective of her friends and family, and hates bullies. She was more tomboyish as a child, 
                though that was frequently shot down by her mother. Airi retains some of her headstrong attitude, though 
                cares greatly for her friends as well as her siblings, taking a sisterly role with both.
                <br><br>
                Before joining her unit, she would frequently think back on her past, bitter of how her agency ended up 
                using her as a TV personality and disregarded her idol activities completely. When she would do this, 
                she'd become snappy and irrational to those who would confront her about her attitude, insulting them, 
                only to feel guilty afterwards.

                Shizuku is the former leader of the idol group Cheerful＊Days, specifically its 3rd generation. Her friend 
                applied to the position for her without Shizuku's knowledge, but she decided to go with it after passing 
                their audition and being awarded as the "Grand Prix winner". She trained to become an idol at the same time as Airi, 
                who openly viewed her as a rival.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, her agency forced her to act out the image of a "perfect idol", leading to her being known among 
                the fans for her beautiful, mysterious, and mature appearance. However, this caused jealousy from the other 
                members of her group, who were forced to constantly back her up, which eventually led to them thinking that 
                she has no special talent and is only popular for her looks. Her groupmates' resentment towards Shizuku built up 
                even more due to her hectic schedule and her inability to prioritize Cheerful＊Days' activities.

                on live streams. While she appears very calm and poised, she does have some quirks, such as putting miso soup 
                in her thermos and being extremely bad with technology. As she grows as an idol, she becomes determined to stay 
                true to herself, not the perfect image she had before.

                Shizuku can also be a bit air-headed, as according to her sister Shiho, she loves going on walks but can't remember 
                any of the street names. As shown in multiple area conversations, she gets lost even in places familiar to her, 
                such as the shopping mall.

            <h2 class="heading">Etymology</h2>
            <p class ="info">            
                Hinomori (日野森) means "a sunny forest".
                <br><br>
                Shizuku (雫) means "droplet". She was named after the scenery her mother saw after she was born; 
                it had just stopped raining, and the raindrops were sparkling in the sunlight.
